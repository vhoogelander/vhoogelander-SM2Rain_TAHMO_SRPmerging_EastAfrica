# SM2Rain_TAHMO_SRPmerging_EastAfrica
This repository contains the methods for improving rainfall estimates in East-Africa by merging satellite-based precipitation products with TAHMO data. 
The methods are based on the statistical uncertainty analysis framework [(SUPER)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425722004059) and the [SM2Rain algorithm](https://github.com/IRPIhydrology/sm2rain).
SM2Rain is used to integrate ground data from TAHMO with satellite measurements, while SUPER merges existing rainfall products, including SM2Rain, to enhance rainfall estimates.
